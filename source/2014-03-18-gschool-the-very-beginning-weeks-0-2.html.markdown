Hello. (Forgive me for my awkwardness, but I haven't blog posted since my middle school Xanga days. Haha)

A little about myself: My name is Bebe, and I am currently a student at gSchool.<br>
No, not grad school. <em>gSchool</em>. It's a 6 month intensive web development workshop where I'm learning how to be a web developer (you can learn about it here <a href="https://www.gschool.it"/>https://www.gschool.it</a> ).

Before all of this I was a mechanical engineer by degree, and a nuclear engineer by profession. So jumping into this web development thing is a bit of a gamble. Honestly, if I didn't have the reassurance that I could program from Java 101 in college (which I realize is only the very basics of object oriented programming), I would never have left Virginia.


Anyways, I started March 3rd, and now I'm on my 3rd week. I'll be writing in here mainly as a reminder to myself what has happened and what kind of path I took to get to my goal of being a good developer.


The first week of gSchool, we mainly focused on command line stuff and boy did I feel a little bit overwhelmed. I remember once as a kid my brother pulled up the command line on my PC and threatened that he would wipe out my entire computer with one press of the button if I didn't give in to his wishes (I don't remember what we were fighting about). Luckily, I pressed the power button with my foot before he could press enter. Ever since then, I stayed far away from the command line. I always viewed it to be too close to the bare essentials of the computer for my comfort. There was no barrier for me to bounce my human errors off of.<br>
Now at the beginning of week 3, I have to say, it's really not as scary as it had seemed. You have to practice in order to learn, and as long as you make sure you are in the right directory, and that you have dummy files to practice with, it's not half bad. In fact, I've found that I enjoy working in the terminal mush more than working with the GUI's of most applications (github in particular).

Here at gSchool we are also working on learning the ins and outs of Ruby. I find a lot of comfort in the fact that I can look up all the syntax I need (thank you internets!). If you asked me to program from my brain alone, I wouldn't be able to do anything terribly complex, but with the internet I feel like ANYTHINGS POSSIBLE! :D Yay Internets!

We've also been doing test driven development(TDD). Wow. I am SOOO glad that the instructors here taught us this process off the bat!(Thanks Mike! Thanks Jeff!) You have no idea how many times (okay, maybe you do if you're a developer) I ran a spec and caught that I broke something. It's not just the whole safety net thing that is great, but I really like the feeling of knowing that what I put out there at least does what I want it to. It kind of comes down to the whole pride in your work thing.

Now that we've gotten into the swing of things I feel comfortable with what I've learned so far.


<h5>Things that I realize I should start looking into:</h5>
<ol>
  <li> File paths. (WHY IS THIS SO DIFFICULT? I know how to write one... IF I KNOW WHERE I AM! ToT)</li>
  <li> Aruba (How the heck does this work?) </li>
  <li> Capybara (ummmm see above. I don't want to use it and never be able to understand what's going on. Must set aside time to research.)</li>
</ol>


I'll write again. Now back to work!
