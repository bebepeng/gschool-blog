Hello~ it’s blog time again! <br>

So it’s week 4 at gSchool right now, and we are finally able to create things that work like real websites! ERB~! <3 Embedded ruby!
We have changing content and multiple views! Now our sites don't look like they are from the dial-up ages! Yayy! Life is exciting!<br>


This week we also started using Sinatra and Capybara. While learning Sinatra we were forced to do a spike. Boy was that painful. Not only did I have to worry about learning the material, but I would also have to have added steps to figure out if things were working or not.
Our assignment was to add, delete, and edit items on a menu. Partner and I did this through the use of a CSV. Although this seemed most intuitive, it was difficult. We got it all working with much pain only to find out it was not intended for us to make a database. We could have used an array or a hash to store our information. Although the data would have reset after you restart the server, it would have served enough for our purposes. I guess our lesson learned here is always ask your product manager for clarification on what he or she wants. There is no point in doing unnecessary work.<br>

Another thing we learned from the spike was to do all of your work in your Sinatra application. Sinatra isn’t just there to let you control the flow of your views. Your Sinatra app should be the location in which you interact directly with your data. My partner and I were trying to pass information in and out of the views directly to the database. Not only does this cloud up your html file but all of your work also becomes public.<br>


<h5>Things I should work on:</h5>
<ul>
<li>playing more with CSS (I want all of my things to be pretty!)</li>
<li>regular expressions (These are still a mystery to me. I should look up some rules)
</ul>


Okay that’s all for now! I’ll be back soon!
