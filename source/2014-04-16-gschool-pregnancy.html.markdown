I'm finishing up week 7 here at gSchool and that means we are almost a third of a way through my journey to becoming a "real" developer.
Truthfully, I'm a little scared considering that we only have 17 weeks left and I still feel like a ruby newbie.
I mean don't get me wrong, I've learned a helluva lot! I just feel like there's so much more to go over. I don't know if I'll ever really be ready to graduate.<br>


I was on the gSchool panel at the Full Stack Meetup in Denver recently, and someone asked me "How far along are you?"
and I responded "Um... about 6 weeks now?" So I realized something. <strong>gSchool:StrongBaseInWebDevelopment::Pregnancy:Baby</strong><br>

Going to gSchool seems a lot like being pregnant... but shorter (although I can't speak from experience of being pregnant).

We spend 6 months getting ready and anticipating for a great new change in our lives.</li>
We've informed all of our loved ones of our new status, and we've even chosen guys that will be leading us through the process.
We cram as much knowledge and training in these weeks to prepare us to become good developers: taking classes, attending lectures, reading books, and practicing.
We have periods of emotional roller coasters as to whether or not we think we can get out in one piece or whether or not we made the right decision to start.
We even dropped or are preparing to drop our previous lifestyles in order to make room for our anticipated new one.
<br> I'm almost positive that my web development skills will be ultra beautiful; I just hope finding a job isn't as painful as delivery.
